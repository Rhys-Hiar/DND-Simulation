Percentage Chance,Item,Description
1,Ring of Rapid Regeneration,"This ring acts as a normal ring of regeneration with one major difference — it regenerates 1 hp per round rather than one per turn. This ring is created by combining a ring of regeneration with a rare distillation of troll’s blood and potions of speed during the enchantment process. One percent of the rings of regeneration found will be rings of rapid regeneration. XP Value: 5,000 GP Value: 50,000"
2,Ring of Para-Elemental Command,"The four types of rings of paraelemental command are lesser versions of the rings of elemental command. Each appears to be nothing more than a normal ring, but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties: 1. Para-elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned cannot approach within 5’ of the wearer or attack the wearer. If the wearer desires, he may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the para-elemental (saving throw applicable at -2 on the die). If the latter fails, however, total protection is lost, and no further attempt at charming can be made. The properties below still function with respect to the para-elemental. 2. Creatures, other than normal paraelementals, from the plane to which the ring is attuned attack at -1 on their “to hit” dice. The ring wearer takes damage at -1 on each hit die and makes applicable saving throws from the creatures’ attacks at +2. In addition, all attacks are made by the wearer of the ring at +4 “to hit” (or - 4 to the para-elemental creature’s saving throw), and the wearer does +6 damage (total, not per die) adjusted by any other applicable bonuses and/or penalties. Any weapon used by the ring wearer can hit para-elementals or quasi-elementals, even if the weapon is not magical. 3. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with the para-elemental creatures of the plane to which the ring is attuned. Recognizing that the character wears the ring, the creatures show a healthy respect to the wearer. Note that the Dungeon Master is free to create any new para-elementals for the relevant planes as desired. 4. In addition, the possessor of a ring of para-elemental command suffers a saving throw penalty as shown in Table 1. 5. Only one power (whether major or minor) of a ring of para-elemental command can be used at one time. Smoke: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: wall of fog (once per hour), fog cloud (twice per day), solid fog (once per week), or free action. The ring appears to be nothing more than a ring of free action until a certain condition is met (such as having the ring blessed, slaying a smoke para-elemental, or whatever is determined necessary to activate its full potential). Ice: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: ice storm (twice per day), wall of ice (twice per day), Otiluke’s freezing sphere (once per week), or warmth. The ring appears to be nothing more than a ring of warmth until the condition established is met Ooze: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: grease (once per turn), melt (once per hour), rock to mud (twice per day), or water walking. The ring appears to be nothing more than a ring of water walking until the condition established is met. Magma: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: burning hands (once per turn), affect normal fires (once per turn), flaming sphere (twice per day), or fire resistance. The ring appears to be nothing more than a ring of fire resistance until the condition established is met. Rings operate at the 12th-level of experience or the minimum level needed to perform the equivalent magic spell (if greater), with respect to range, duration, or area of effect determinations which might apply. The additional powers each take only five segments to bring forth. XP Value: 4,000 GP Value: 20,000"
3,Ring of Quasi-Elemental Command,"The eight types of quasi-elemental command rings are lesser versions of the paraelemental command rings. Each has certain powers (detailed below), as well as the following common properties: 1. Quasi-elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned cannot approach within 5 of the wearer or attack the wearer. If the wearer desires, he or she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the quasi-elemental (saving throw applicable at -2 on the die). If the latter fails, however, total protection is lost, and no further attempt at charming can be made. The secondary properties given below then function with respect to the quasi-elemental. 2. Creatures, other than normal quasielementals, from the plane to which the ring is attuned attack at -1 on their to hit dice. Also, the ring wearer takes damage at -1 on each hit die and makes applicable saving throws from the creatures attacks at +2. All attacks are made by the wearer of the ring at +4 to hit (or -4 to the quasi-elemental creatures saving throw) and the wearer does +6 damage (total, not per die) adjusted by any other applicable bonuses and/or penalties. Any weapon used by the ring wearer can hit quasi-elementals, even if the weapon is not magical. 3. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with the quasi-elemental creatures of the plane to which the ring is attuned. Recognizing that the character wears the ring, the creatures show a healthy respect to the ring wearer. Note that the Dungeon Master is free to create any new quasi-elementals for the relevant planes as desired. 4. In addition, the possessor of a ring of quasi-elemental command suffers a saving throw penalty as shown on Table 2. 5. Only one power of a ring of quasielemental command can be used at one time 6. All rings of quasi-elemental command detect as magic, but do not identify precisely until a certain condition is met (such as having the ring blessed, slaying a quasielemental of the type to which the ring is attuned, or whatever is determined necessary to activate its full potential). Lightning: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: shocking grasp (once per turn) or lightning bolt (four times per week). Steam: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: melt (once per turn) or fog cloud (twice per day). Radiance: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: rainbow pattern (once per hour) or sunray (twice per week). Mineral: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: transmute metal to wood (once per day) or wall of stone (once per day). Vacuum: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: unseen servant (once per day) or negative plane protection (four times per week). Salts: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: irritation (twice per day) or preserve (twice per day). Ash: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: pass without trace (once per hour) or detect invisibility (once per hour). The ring appears to be nothing more than a magic ring until the condition established is met. Dust: At will, the wearer produces the following magical effects: dust devil (once per day) or transmute water to dust (once per day). Rings operate at the 12th-level of experience or the minimum level needed to perform the equivalent magic spell or wand effect (if greater), with respect to range, duration, or area of effect determinations which might apply. The powers take only five segments to bring forth. XP Value: 2,000 GP Value: 10,000"
4,Ring of Range Extension,"This item allows any spellcaster (including rangers, paladins, and the like) to voluntarily extend the range of any spell cast, save those spells with ranges of 0 or touch. Each such ring contains 2-40 charges and cannot be recharged. Each charge used increases the range of any spell cast by the amount listed as the normal range. Thus, if one charge is used, the range is doubled; two charges triple the range, three quadruple it, and so on. A ring of range extension may be successfully used on spells cast from scrolls or other magical devices, but cannot be used to cast a spell into a plane other than that which the user currently occupies. XP Value: 2,000 GP Value: 10,000"
5,Ring of Clairaudience,"This ring's gem is a small amethyst with a normal value of 100 gp. The amethyst is easily separated from the ring; it can then be placed in a location on which the owner wishes to eavesdrop. A pick pockets roll allows a thief to secretly slip the amethyst into the clothes of another character. Any character can hide the gem in an empty room, barring extraordinary circumstances. Whatever is said within 60 of the amethyst is magically transmitted to the ring itself, and the words are then heard by the ring-wearer alone. The gem-ring connection has a range of 48, but only transmits sounds that could be heard by a normal human in the same location as the amethyst. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 7,500"
6,Ring of Teleportation,"This enchanted ring commonly has 3-30 charges when found. The rings gem is a deep blue spinel worth 500 gp if sold as an ordinary gem. The gem is easily separated from the ring and placed anywhere to which the rings user wishes to be transported at a later time. By expending one charge, the wearer of the ring is teleported without error to a safe location within 5 of the spinel. The gem can be retrieved and reused as long as the ring retains at least one charge. If no safe location exists near the location of the gem (say, if it is buried under 10 of earth or is inside a burning building), the ring expends four charges and nothing happens. The gem must be obtained in order for the ring to work again. XP Value: 2,000 GP Value: 15,000"
7,Ring of Command,"A ring of command commonly has 3-30 charges when found. The ring has the following abilities, only one of which can be used at any one time: 1. Command: This ability duplicates the first-level clerical spell with the same name. Creatures with an intelligence of 13 or better (highly intelligent and above monsters) or with more than 5 HD or levels are entitled to a saving throw versus spells. A command uses up one charge for every round the command is in effect. For instance, an orc could be told to die! and would stay dead (unconscious) for five rounds if five charges were spent. 2. Charm person: This power is the same as the first-level magic-user spell. Two charges must be spent to charm a character, and an additional charge per day must be expended to continue the spell each day thereafter. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spells to negate the charm. A character using a ring of command can expend another two charges to try again, of course, in the event of spell failure. 3. Suggestion: This ability is similar to, the third-level magic-user spell. The target of a suggestion is allowed a saving throw vs. spells, as with charm person above. A suggestion costs two charges and lasts for one hour. More charges can be spent for additional hours, at a rate of one per hour, as desired. All of these powers only work on the humanoids listed in the Players Handbook under charm person, and their counterparts in the FIEND FOLIO® Tome and Monster Manual II. XP Value: 2,000 GP Value: 10,000"
8,Ring of Phantom Form,"The user of this ring can disperse his bodys molecules at will, so as to become totally intangible. This ring does not allow the user to become invisible, as he will appear to be translucent in form. (Rings of invisibility and phantom form cannot be used together at the same time. The spell invisibility can be successfully cast upon the user of a ring of phantom form, however.) An intangible character cannot be hit by normal weapons, but is affected normally by weapons with a +1 or better magical bonus. An intangible character cannot physically attack, but may cast spells. Heat, cold, and electrical attacks (lightning bolt, fireball, etc.) affect an intangible character normally. The user of a ring of phantom form can move through screens, pipes, and other narrow apertures at a 12 movement rate. All items carried by a character in phantom form are likewise rendered intangible. If a character fails a saving throw against any magical attack form which can harm him, all carried items must likewise save vs. that attack form or else be destroyed. XP Value: 1,500 GP Value: 7,500"
9,Ring of Shape Changing,"This ring commonly possesses 3-30 charges when found. Each of the charges expended allows the wearer to shape change as per the ninth-level magic-user spell shape change. The wearer of this ring may change back to his original form at will, without expending a ring charge. However, there is a 2% chance per shape assumed that the wearer permanently assumes the form of the thing into which he changes. In this event, the character assumes all mental and personality-related characteristics of this new form 2-16 days after taking the form. A character stuck in an unfamiliar form can only regain his former shape by having dispel magic, alter reality, limited wish, or wish cast upon him. XP Value: 2,500 GP Value: 15,000"
10,Ring of Tongues,"The wearer of this magical ring can understand, read, write, and speak any language known by any creature within 30 of the ring, as long as that creature stays within the area of effect. Two rings of this sort within 30 of each other automatically cancel each other out. Additionally, it is possible for a character wearing this ring to learn a language (where this learning is warranted, as by an increase in intelligence or similar circumstance) from another character as expressed in the rules regarding language learning; half the normal time for this is required. (For further information on this, see page 34 of the Players Handbook.) XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 5,000"
11,Ring of the Drow,"This item is made of eight strands of different unique metals entwined to form a ring. The drow found it troublesome when their magical items deteriorated upon leaving their underground homeland for long periods of time; to combat this, they created this ring. The ring of the drow is only made in the drow homelands by clerics of Lolth. Its purpose is to keep drow-made items the wearer possesses from deteriorating. To do so, the ring radiates an aura of magical energy that duplicates the radiations deep in the drow homelands. This aura only affects the wearer and the wearers possessions. As a side effect of the rings magical aura, a detect magic spell reveals the wearer to radiate magic strongly. In addition, a detect evil shows the wearer of one of these rings as evil, and a know alignment indicates that the wearer is chaotic evil, regardless of the wearers true alignment. If the wearer uses the psionic power of aura alteration to try to change the aura, the wearer must save vs. spells or else change alignment to chaotic evil. If the wearer saves, or if the wearer fails the save but is already chaotic evil, the psionic power functions normally, and the rings aura is temporarily changed. To possess one of these rings is considered an honor among the drow, because it signifies that the wearer has traveled far from the homeland, and that he or she was aided by a cleric favored by Lolth. Drow will kill any creature other than a drow who possesses one of these rings. XP Value: 1,000 (to drow); nil to others GP Value: 5,000 (to drow); 1,000 to others"
12,Ring of Fire Starting,"The beauty of this ring is obvious under even the most casual inspection. Its band is forged from a bright, silvery metal and has an intricate bas-relief of an ancient fire-tending ceremony carved into its surface. The stone is a 5,000 gp diamond and glows with a faint inner light. When it is worn, a slight sensation of warmth can be felt emanating from it. If the wearer touches the stone to any combustible substance and speaks a command word, the material must save vs. magical fire or else burst into flame. The material need not be entirely dry or pure, and the conditions do not have to be temperate in order for the ring to function. This ring has an unlimited number of uses. It is itself immune to all fire- and heat-based effects, magical or otherwise. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 3,500"
13,Ring of Quick Action,"A ring of quick action enables a fighter, cavalier, barbarian, ranger, or paladin to gain the initiative at the start of melee, regardless of any other factors, including the condition of the opposition. The ring can be used 2-20 times in this manner before it runs out of charges and becomes useless. Expending a charge is an automatic action requiring a mental command at the start of a melee round. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 5,000"
14,Ring of Animal Magnetism,"Once placed on a characters finger, this ring allows communication with all animals as if the wearer had an 18 charisma. The wearer may speak with animals for as long as the ring is worn, though the ring does not allow the wearer to charm animals in any manner. Only true animals (mammals, birds, fishes, reptiles, etc.) may be spoken to in this manner; magical monsters are not affected. For the purposes of this ring, assume that any creature capable of using magical spells is a monster. Thus, a pegasus is an animal, but a unicorn is a monster; an owlbear or worg is an animal, but a bugbear (since clerical bugbears exist) or a winter wolf is a monster. The wearer may try to convince animals to work or fight for him, and reaction is checked as if the animals were randomly encountered humans. Animals will not attack the wearer of the ring unless attacked first, even if they are hungry. However, 10% of these rings are cursed to draw any and all animals within one mile toward the wearer. The animals then surround the wearer and refuse to move, blocking the wearers path in all directions. If the wearer or his party attacks any animal, all the animals attack the wearer at once. If the ring is removed (requiring a remove curse spell), the animals revert to normal, and either attack (1-2 on d6) or flee (3-6 on d6). XP Value: 1,000 (Nil for cursed version) GP Value: 5,000 (1,000 for cursed version)"
15,Ring of Neutralization,"This magical ring can be employed by any character class. Its sole function is to protect the wearer from the effects of a predetermined offensive magic-user spell. Each ring has the ability to totally negate any damage or ill effects from a given specific spell, as noted in an inscription on the ring itself. A ring of fireball neutralization, for example, allows a character to stand in the center of a fireball blast and be totally unharmed. A ring of neutralization uses a charge every time a spells effects are nullified. A typical ring of this sort, when found, has 4-16 charges. It can only be recharged by a 12th-level magicuser or higher, to a maximum of 20 charges, but this requires a prolonged and costly ritual (1 day and 1,000 gp per charge). A charge is lost from the ring for each predesignated attack made on an individual wearing it. A magic missile or Melf's minute meteor spell forces rings matched for those spells to use a charge for each separate missile stopped. For example, if four magic missiles are negated by a ring of magic-missile negation, then four charges are used. A ring of neutralization only nullifies one type of spell. For example, if a character is wearing a ring of cone-of-cold neutralization and is the target of an ice storm spell, he takes normal damage from the attack. Spells with similar effects are nonetheless considered different for purposes of using this spell-dedicated ring; a delayed blast fireball does normal damage if a character is wearing a ring of fireball neutralization. Similarly, a character wishing protection from both lightning bolts and a chain lightning spell would require two different rings. Only the person wearing the ring of neutralization is immune to that spells effects. Anyone else caught in the area of effect takes normal damage or suffers the effects of that particular spell. XP Value: 1,500 GP Value: 7,500"
16,Ring of the Bards,"This rare magical ring, when worn by a character other than a bard, acts as a ring of protection, +2. It can be recognized by the engraved golden vines encircling the band. When placed on the finger of a bard, it retains its protection properties, but with a bonus. The ring then serves as a ring of protection +2, +4 saving throws. It also raised the bards charm percentage by 10%. This magic item is usually found in a wilderness or forest area. XP Value: 3,000 GP Value: 15,000"
17,Ring of Limited Telepathy,"These rare magic rings appear only in pairs, each ring matching the other perfectly in appearance. This ring combination allows the wearer to communicate telepathically with the wearer of the other ring only, though there are restrictions on this. These rings have a telepathic range of 2,000 miles, but function only when both rings and their wearers are on the same plane of existence. These rings are normally made and enchanted for a specific pair of users for example, for a husband and wife, a pair of allied adventurers, or a brother and sister. Notice that in each case, one partner must be male and the other female. This is a function of the enchanting, which enhances sympathetic feelings between such pairs, capitalizing on gender attraction as well. Also, because the rings are enchanted for a specific pair of wearers, the chance that two persons randomly DRAGON 49 finding such rings and being able to use them is almost nil. A remote chance exists that two persons of the same gender who are very closely allied or related (e.g., twins, friends or lovers who have been together for at least 10 years, a parent and child, etc.) can make use of these rings, but the effective range is reduced to 500 miles, and there is a 20% chance per day that the rings do not function for that day. Successful use of these rings allows each wearer a +4 saving throw against any sort of psionic attack, psionic discipline, or magical effect which affects the mind and will of the wearer. This includes all charms, dominations, possessions, suggestions, and holds, as well as fear, quest, confusion, etc. The use of ESP or telepathy by another person against the wearer of such a ring will immediately reveal the use of such rings to the skrying character. However, if the saving throw against the attacks mentioned above is failed, the ringwearers partner (who might not be present during the attack) must save vs. spells at +2 or else suffer the same spell or psionic effects. Thus, if a ring-wearer was subjected to a scare spell, the other ring-wearer must save vs. spells at +2 or else be scared as well. Use the Wisdom Spell Immunities table in Legends & Lore to determine which spells are applicable in these cases. In the event of dire need, such as when one ring-wearer is unconscious, dying, or in great pain, a strong feeling of distress is felt by the partner. By complete concentration, the partner can determine the distressed ring-wearers location. This takes a full turn to complete. If one ring-wearer is slain, the partner must save vs. spells (with will-force bonuses) or else pass into a coma for 2-20 hours. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 5,000"
18,Ring of Fashion,"The ring of fashion, when commanded with the proper key word, immediately dresses the user in any sort of clothing the character can dream of, short of true armor of any sort (all costumes are AC 10). One out of 10 of all such rings allow the wearer to create heavy clothing that can be counted as padded armor (AC 8). Unfortunately, there is also a 1% chance that the ring will create a completely random set of clothing that lasts for 1-6 turns before fading. Such clothing appears in place of any other sort of clothing worn when the ring is activated. No metallic or metal-studded armor can be worn by the user when the ring is activated, or else the ring will not function. Magical metallic items of small size, such as rings, bracers, or jewelry, do not affect the function of this device. However, magical and normal suits of leather or cloth armor will vanish once this ring is activated, returning only 50 JANUARY 1986 when the rings effects are dispelled or negated. All magical girdles, boots, cloaks, and the like will likewise vanish and return later. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 3,000"
19,Ring of Annulment,"While this ring is worn, magic controlled by the character has no effect. This includes magical items, spells, and innate magical powers. Spells cast at the character from an outside source, however, act as normal. Thus, heal or fireball affect the wearer normally, but the ring-wearer cannot cure his own wounds using magic. A remove curse must be cast upon the ring in order to allow the wearer to remove it. A dispel magic spell has a 1% chance per level of the caster of negating the rings powers for one round, allowing the wearer to remove it. XP Value: Nil GP Value: 2,000"
20,Ring of Distraction,"This ring appears to be a normal ring of any other sort. In combat, this ring is capable of generating a sudden burst of light and sound that is perceived only by one opponent in melee with the ringwearer (including those firing or hurling missile weapons within a 60 range). The burst of light and sound is heard by no one else, and the target victim is designated by the ring-wearers mental commands. This distraction causes the attacker to gain a -4 penalty on all attacks for the current round. If the opponent saves vs. spells, the penalty is reduced to a -2 to hit result. This attack is made at the start of a melee round, regardless of all other circumstances, as it is a mental command. The ring may be used in this fashion up to five times per day. Once placed on a finger, the ring reveals its powers to its wearer. One out of five (20%) of these rings do not operate on a conscious mental command, however. These rings simply generate their flash and sound burst for the first five melee rounds in which the wearer is involved in combat in a day. As a result, the wearer might not immediately be aware that the ring is having any effect at all, though the ring-wearers opponents may appear to act strangely. Another 5% of these rings are cursed (and cannot be removed without a remove curse spell) to cause the flash and noise-burst to affect the wearer himself and no one else. XP Value: 1,000 (nil for cursed version) GP Value: 5,000 (1,000 for cursed version)"
21,Ring of Vapors,"The origin of this unique ring is greatly disputed, but most mages agree that a powerful figure among the air elementals had a hand in its creation. The ring appears as a small circlet of misty vapors that continually shift and change; the ring, however, is solid. Any character wearing the ring gains the following abilities: At will Fly (12) Once per day Stinking cloud Once per day Obscurement Thrice per week Wind walk Thrice per week Wind wall Twice per week Aerial servant Once per week Cloudkill Once per month Summon aid from Elemental Plane of Air* * Wearers alignment good djinni: wearers alignment neutral 8 HD air elemental; and wearers alignment evil mihstu. All spell effects are at the 16th level of ability. Summoned monsters will remain with the summoner for only 4-16 rounds, after which they depart. Summoned monsters will not attack the summoner unless attacked first, and they act in a friendly and helpful manner during the time they are present. The wearer also receives a penalty on saving throws versus fire, against which he saves at - 2 and takes +1 damage per die. It is possible that the maker of this ring is still hunting for it. XP Value: 4,000 GP Value: 35,000"
22,Ring of Lolth,"On an unknown layer of the Abyss, Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, fashioned this unique ring and bestowed it upon her most powerful priestess for the latters faithful service during the Age of Despair, when the drow were driven into the underworld. Using the powers of the ring, the high priestess ruled a vast underground empire with an iron hand for hundreds of years, sacrificing thousands on the altar of her goddess. This reign of terror was ended by a massive assault against the subterranean Spider Temple by mercenary adventurers, at which time this ring was lost. It has reappeared from time to time, however, in the service of evil characters particularly drow, of course. At first glance, the Ring of Lolth appears to be a miniature figure of a black spider with curled legs and glowing red eyes. The legs curved down and around to form the ring shape. Any character sliding a finger through the legs, thus properly wearing the ring, is pricked by a hidden needle and must save vs. poison at -4 or die instantly. This save is instantly made for all pure-blooded drow. If the save is successful, the ring gives the wearer the following powers/abilities: 1. Immunity to all spider venoms; 2. Spider climb at will; 3. Cast a double-sized web (as per the spell) once per turn; 4. Cast stones to spiders once per day (this spell is identical to the clerical spell sticks to snakes in most respects, changing six stones into large spiders, as per the Monster Manual, for 12 rounds; all spiders so created are venomous); 5. Ability to sense enemies as per a wand of enemy detection; 6. Ability to charm and control all arachnids within 120 (no saving throw allowed if ring is worn by a drow; otherwise, a normal save vs. spells is given to the monsters); and, 7. Ability to shift out of phase as a phase spider, allowing wearer to attack opponents with a +3 to die rolls for surprise. The drow will fight to the death to recover this ring if it falls into the hands of those who are not drow. In addition, there is a 2% chance per day (noncumulative) that Lolths personal attention is drawn to any owner who is not a drow. XP Value: 4,000 GP Value: 30,000"
23,Ring of Languages,"This ring is basically a limited version of the ring of tongues (listed above). Instead of gaining the ability to fully understand any language known by any creature within 30, the wearer gains a number of languages conferred by the ring while the ring is worn. The wearer not only understands these languages he is also able to speak, read, and write the languages as if they wear his native tongue. Note that once the ring is removed from the finger, the wearer loses the ability to understand the languages the ring possesses. It is possible, however, for a character whose intelligence has increased (thereby allowing the learning of one or more additional languages), or for a character with the ability to learn another language, to learn a language possessed by the ring merely by wearing it. This process requires the wearer to wear the ring consecutively for one month, after which time (due to the magically accelerated ability to learn) the character understands the language entirely, without the rings further assistance. Only one language may be so learned at a time. The number of languages possessed by a ring is determined by rolling 2d4; the languages are picked from the table listed on page 102 of the Dungeon Masters Guide or from a language table of the DMs own devising. A roll of 86-00 on this table indicates either a common tongue, an alignment language, the thieves cant, or the druidic tongue, as determined by the following table. Duplications on this table are merely rerolled. d100 Language 01-60 Human (common, foreign, or other) 61-70 Lawful* 71-80 Neutral* 81-90 Chaotic* 91-95 Thieves cant 96-00 Druidic tongue. * Roll d6: 1-2, Good; 3-4, Neutral; 5-6, Evil. XP Value: 1,000 GP Value: 5,000"
24,Ring of Crius,"Crius is the greater titan of density and gravity, and was one of those thrown down from power by his descendents (see legends & Lore, page 62). Being jealous of the new (Olympian) gods that the mortals worship, and having a desire to control the fate of those on the Prime Material Plane, Crius placed a portion of his powers in a ring and cast into the world. The ring is of plain copper with the name “Crius” engraved on the inside and performs simply as a ring of feather ralling until it is immersed in the blood of a cleric (of at least 5th level) of one of the Greek gods, at which time its true powers become known. At will: Decrease body density as per the psionic ability body equilibrium (the wearer takes double damage from all attacks at this time). At will: Create a gravity field around the wearer which causes all launched missiles (arrows, spears, etc.) to fall short and miss, if they fail to save vs. disintegration. Once per day: Increase body density to act as a triple strength stone skin spell (three attacks or attack sequences affected; the wearer is at half movement at this time). Once per day: Reverse gravity as a 10th level magic-user. Once per day: Increase gravity in a 4” x 4” area to such a degree that all creatures and objects within this area are immobilized. If a save vs. spells is made, creatures are still affected as if under a slow spell. A select group of clerics of Zeus have been chosen to search for and destroy the Ring of Crius. This brotherhood will go to any length to carry out their quest, for the ring is thought to be linked to a possible rebellion of the titans against the Greek gods. XP Value: 3,500. GP Value: 25,000"
25,Ring of Magic Resistance,"As their name describes, these rings impart magic resistance upon their wearers. These rings do not increase the natural magic resistance a wearer may have – they do not provide a cumulative figure for magic resistance. For example, a being with a natural magic resistance of 50% wearing a ring of magic resistance, 45% does not gain a magic resistance of 95%; rather, the wearer gains the higher magic resistance of the two (in this case, the innate figure of 50%). Consequently, the ring is ineffective in respect to this wearer as a result. The effective magic resistance of the ring is obtained by rolling percentile dice and checking the Magic Resistance Ring Table. XP Value: 500 5% of MR (1,000 xp for 5% however). GP Value: 2,000 per 5% of MR"

The wearer is allotted the rings set constitution, in as far as it pertains to health, recovery of hit points, ability to consume amounts of liquor, and system shock and resurrection percentages; this does not, however, pertain to hit points conferred by a high constitution whenever a new level is attained. For example, wearing the ring of health (constitution 16) would allot a 96% chance of successful revival if the wearer is killed, while a ring of health (constitution 19) would give a + 1 on saving throws versus poison, Neither ring gives the wearer any additional hit points. The ring must be worn for at least a week before the wearer gains its benefits. No benefits are realized by placing such a ring on a dead person in an attempt to revive him. The type of ring is determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the table below:"
