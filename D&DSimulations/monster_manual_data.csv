AERIAL SERVANT,Very rare ,1,3,"24""",16,0,Nil,1,8-32,Surprises on 1-4,Can be hit only by magic weapons,Standard,Semi-,Neutral,8' tall,Nil,Nil,"The aerial servant is a semi-intelligent form of an air elemental. It IS typically encountered only due to conjuration by a cleric, although these creatures roam the ethereal and astral planes and when encountered there can be dimly seen. An aerial servant is normally invisible. Aerial ser- vants do not fight per se, but they are exceedingly strong and very fast. They can carry weights in excess of 10,ooO gold pieces, and if they grasp any creature it requires an 18 strength to have any chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the creature has, there is a like chance to escape the grasp of the aerial servant, i.e. a human with an 18/50% strength has a 50% chance of breaking free of the grasp, and a 00% or 19 indicates automatic breaking of the grasp. They travel at twice the speed of an invisible stalker, and when on the physical plane they are able to achieve surprise on a die roll of 1-4 (out of 6). If the aerial servant is frustrated from completion of its assigned mission it becomes insane, returns to the cleric which sent it forth, and attacks as a double strength in- visible stalker. Likewise, if it is encountered ethereally or astrally the aerial servant will typically attack in the same fashion. Far further details regarding aerial servants consult the volume detailing clerical spells."

Thus it will usually be found in forests and choice agricultural land. This causes farmers great consternation, since the anhkheg likes to supplement its earthly diet of soil with a bit of fresh meat, human or otherwise. Since its mouth is not designed to rip and tear meat, its mandibles crush its prey and secrete a digestive enzyme causing an additional 1-4 points per turn until the prey is completely dissolved. If sorely pressed in battle it is able to squirt its digestive acids 30 feet once per six hours. However when it does this it cannot digest anything for the same length of time, so it usually will bite. A squirt of digestive acid causes 8-32 hit points of damage to the creature struck, half the amount if the creature makes its saving throw. The anhkheg's favorite method of attacking is lying 5-10 feet underneath the ground until its antenna detects a likely victim passing overhead. Then it burrows out directly underneath the prey and grabs it.  Description: The anhkheg has a chitinous shell which is brownish in color. Its underside is pinkish. The creature's eyes are glistening black. "

The warrior ant has 3 hit dice, does 2-8 hit points of damage with its mandibles, and if it hits with them it will also attempt to sting for 3-12 points of damage. If o sting hits, a saving throw versus poison must be made; if successful the victim takes only 1-4 hit points of damage. The queen ant has 10 hit dice, but she neither moves nor attacks. If she is killed the other ants will become confused (as if they were under the influence of that spell) for six melee rounds and then leave the nest. Treasure held by ants will be found in the chamber of the queen ant. The egg chamber will be guarded by 5-50 workers ond 5 warriors. Giant ant eggs have no normal market value. "

However, if its gaze is reflected so that the basilisk sees its own eyes, it will itself be petrified, but this requires light at least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. Basilisks are usually dull brown with yellowish underbellies. Their eyes are glowing pale green. The basilisk is able to see in both the astral and ethereal planes.

Bombardier Beetle: This beetle is usually found in wooded areas above ground. It feeds on offal and carrion primarily, gothering huge heaps of such material in which to lay its eggs. If this beetle is attacked or disturbed there is a 50% chance each melee round that it will turn its rear towards its attacker(s) and fire off an 8' X 8' X 8' cloud of reeking, reddish acidic vapor from its abdomen.

The creature's eyestalks and eyes are also protected, although less well (thus the armor classes of 2 and 7 respectively). Because of its particular nature the beholder is able to withstand the loss of its eyestalks, these members are not computed as part of its hit point damage potential, and lost eyestalkswill eventually grow back (1 week per lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand one-third this total, i.e. a beholder with 45 hit points con withstand 30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed; the eleventh eye can withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. Eyestalks take from 8 to 12 hit points each before being lost. The body of a beholder represents75%of potential hit area, the central eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.
Eyes: The various eyes of a beholder each have a different function. Typically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks are able to function considering that the attack is coming from an arc 90' before the monster. If attacks come from 180"" double the number of eyestalks able to function, and for 270"" or 360"" triple or quadruple the number.
